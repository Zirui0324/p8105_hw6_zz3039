## Problem 2

For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

```{r}
homi_data = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep=", "),
    status = case_when(
      disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest", "Closed without arrest") ~ "solved",
      TRUE ~ "unsolved"),
    status = as.factor(status),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX",
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ",
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL",
         victim_race == "White"|victim_race == "Black")
```
